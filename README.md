# Instana content

## Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide content that includes Docs, sample files, and code snippets for Instana, for example, configuration yaml files, script sample files, and so on. You can directly download these files for either installing or configuring Instana. 

## Usage

To understand and use Instana, see the [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current) and select the appropriate version.

In the documentation, if the sample yaml file or script file is long, it is not included in the content. Instead, it is available inside this repo and linked to from the topic. By clicking the link in the topic, you open the specific file url and can then download the file to your local directory for direct use.

You can also find the pdf files and offline html files of documentation for older versions. 

## Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure that your patches are tested. Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change that you make. For example:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Added some feature').
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature).
5. Create new Pull Request.
